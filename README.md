## Functionality / Technologies
   
#### General 
   The site links to Bootstrap 3.3.7 and makes use of its form styling and grid system.

The site links to Fontawesome  and makes use of icons for the social media and also for the nav elements.

The site uses  the Do+Hyeon and Roboto font from Google Fonts.

My own further styling has been done within css/main.css
 "w3schools.com/color picker" helps me for color scheme.
 
 #### Header and Footer
  The Bootstrap grid system was utilised for the grids making up the header and footer.

The header contains one of the supplied images which is being used as a logo. Clicking/tapping on this logo will take the user to the homepage - functionality that the average user has come to expect from a website.
 The over header  will be hidden in 768px width small screen
